# Conway’s Game of Life (Parallel Version)

This directory contains a Conway’s Game of Life implementation written in Go using Ebiten / Ebitengine v2.
It was inspired by the classic online article about Game of Life (the single-threaded version), but I made four changes:

1. Switched to the modern API: `github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2`.
2. Kept the original Game of Life rules.
3. Made the “compute next generation” step parallelby using multiple goroutines.
4. Kept rendering single-threaded(because Ebiten images are not goroutine-safe).

## Notes

This implementation follows the idea of the article “Implementing Conway’s Game of Life in Go”, but:

* I did not copy the old Ebiten API — I rewrote it with ebiten/v2.
* I wrapped the logic into an `ebiten.Game` structure.
* I replaced the original “two nested `for` loops to compute the next generation” with a parallel version.

So you can say: the rules are the same, the style is modern, and the update step is parallel.
